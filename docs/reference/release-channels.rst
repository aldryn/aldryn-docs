Release channels
################

Aldryn provides three *Release channels* for Addons and other software:

* *Alpha*
* *Beta*
* *Stable*

All software on Aldryn is released into a particular release channel, which can be changed at any
time.

By default, new Addons are released in the *Alpha* channel.

As a software developer, you are encouraged to leave new software in the *Alpha* channel until it
has been tested and proven, preferably by multiple users and in multiple configurations.

*Alpha* and *Beta* should not mean that the software is not-ready for use. In fact we strongly
discourage publishing untested or unstable software on Aldryn.

It's fine to upload and share new Addons for testing and development purposes, but quality on the
Marketplace should be maintained by ensuring that nothing is actually :ref:`published
<publishing_is_irreversible>` before it's ready for general use.

.. note::

    If necessary, software that doesn't meet quality standards may have its release channel altered
    by Aldryn system administrators, or even removed.
