Publishing an Addon on Aldryn's Marketplace
###########################################

If your Addon's only for private use, you don't need to publish it, and the steps in the
:ref:`working_locally_on_backend` tutorial will be enough for you to use your plugin on Aldryn on
your own sites.

If you'd like other people to make use of it, you need to take some additional steps.


********************************
Add information about the plugin
********************************

In the `Aldryn Control Panel <https://control.aldryn.com/control/>`_, select `Addons
<https://control.aldryn.com/account/my-addons/>`_ and then the Addon you want to publish.


General settings
================

*Publish on django-cms.org* will mean that it's also listed amongst the `django CMS Addons
<https://www.django-cms.org/en/add-ons/>`_, as well as on the `Aldryn Marketplace
<http://aldryn.com/marketplace>`_.

A *License* is **required** for publication.

A good *Description* that helps users understand what this software is for and what it does is
essential for a successful Addon.


Package information
===================

Choose a suitable :ref:`Release channel <release-channels>`.


Sharing settings
================

An Addon is *private* until *published* by using the **Publish** button.

Note that publishing is irreversible. Once published, an Addon **cannot** be made private again, so
please make sure that you are ready for it to be published before using the button.
