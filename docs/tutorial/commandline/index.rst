Aldryn for backend developers
##############################

This tutorial is a guide for users who want to learn how Aldryn works for web application
developers.

The tutorial takes you through steps from installing key software such as Docker to deploying
Aldryn projects locally so that you can develop new software for them.

You don't need to know how to use Docker, Git or the other technologies we'll introduce, but you do
need to have some basic familiarity with the command-line on your system.

You also need to have a number of packages installed on your local computer. See :ref:`local_dev_install_configure` for more information.

.. note::

    We assume in this section of the tutorial that you are familiar with the material introduced
    in the :ref:`tutorial_content_creators` tutorial, and have an Aldryn project ready to work with.

    If not, please take a few minutes to work through that tutorial before returning here.
