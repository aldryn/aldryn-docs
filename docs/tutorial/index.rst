This tutorial is a guide for new users, to lead you from the very basics of setting up your Aldryn
account to much more advanced tasks.

The tutorial is divided into three sections.

:ref:`Aldryn for content creators <tutorial_content_creators>`
    an introduction to using the **Control Panel** to manage your project and build your website
    using django CMS (new users should start here)
:ref:`Aldryn for frontend developers <tutorial_frontend_developers>`
    an introduction to using the **Aldryn desktop application** to work on your site's design and
    layout
:ref:`Aldryn for backend developers <tutorial_backend_developers>`
    an introduction to using the **Aldryn command-line client** to run your site locally and
    develop new applications


Some sections - which are indicated as optional - can be skipped if they are not of interest, but
they're all quite short and we recommend you work your way through the whole tutorial if you can,
to get an introduction to the whole system.
