Create a new project
####################

In the Control Panel, select **Add a new Project**.

You'll be invited to choose what kind of new project you'd like to create.

You can start with a blank project but for this tutorial choose the second option, **Start with a
theme and content**.

This will duplicate our demonstration *Explorer site* for you.

Give the project a name (note that Aldryn projects must have unique names, so if you choose a name
that already exists you'll need to choose another). Don't worry about the *Organisation* field for
now.

Select the **Duplicate Project** button.

Your new project's **Dashboard** will open, and will display a *Duplicating website’s data* message.

Once the process has completed a *Success Duplicating website’s data* message will appear.

To use the site, you need to deploy it. But before you proceed to that, let's finish setting it up
by applying some basic settings.


=========================================
Configure your project's general Settings
=========================================

Go to *General settings* in the project's Dashboard, and set:

* *International Settings*: select the languages in which you plan to publish your site.
* *Domain Settings*: don't worry about this now, but later if you have a *Premium* - i.e. paid-for -
  account, you'll be able to publish the site from your own domain.
* *Base Project Release Channel Settings*: leave this set to *Stable*.

===================
Deploy your project
===================

Your new project needs to be deployed. This actually creates the website.

First you deploy a private version for testing, and then later you can publish a live version for
all the world to see.

Back in your project's Dashboard, hit **Test it** to deploy the site to the *Test server*.

.. NOTE::
   For the moment, we will work only with the Test server; later, we'll look at the Live server
   too. This should be a stand-out note of some sort.

You'll see a blue progress bar, and below it a timer. When the progress bar turns green, your
site's ready for use.

Whenever you make any future changes to the configuration of your project, it will need to be
redeployed in the same way before they take effect. You can make numerous changes and deploy them
all at once.

Now **Login** to your newly-deployed site.


Failed deployments
==================

Occasionally, a deployment will fail. This can happen for various reasons. The previous version
will be unaffected. Repeat the deployment. If it fails again, contact the Aldryn team for support,
either `by email <mailto:support@aldryn.com>`_ or by using the *Intercom tool* on any page on the
Aldryn website.
