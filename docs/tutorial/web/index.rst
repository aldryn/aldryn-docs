This tutorial is a guide for new users, to lead you from the very basics of using the Control Panel
to up your Aldryn account to creating content and managing your site.

Some sections - which are indicated as optional - can be skipped if they are not of interest, but
they're all quite short and we recommend you work your way through the whole tutorial if you can,
to get an introduction to the whole system.
