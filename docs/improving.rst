Helping improve Aldryn's documentation
######################################

Whether you're a core member of the Aldryn development team or a visitor trying it out for the
first time, you can make a valuable contribution to Aldryn as a whole by helping us improve this
documentation.

You can help by:

* `giving us feedback <mailto:support@aldryn.com>`_ about something you thought was poorly or
  confusingly or simply not explained
* `sending us your suggestion <mailto:support@aldryn.com>`_ for better wording or ways of
  explaining something
* sending us a pull request via `GitHub <https://github.com/aldryn/aldryn-docs>`_

Remember that you don't need any technical expertise to be able to make useful comments about
documentation. In fact if you're not an expert, your opinion is especially important.

***********************
Documentation structure
***********************

The documentation's structure reflects its three chief functions:

* :doc:`/tutorial/index`: step-by-step guides for the new user
* :doc:`/how-to/index`: more advanced guides for developers
* :doc:`Reference </reference/index>` to provide in-depth technical reference material

As far as possible when writing documentation it should be aimed at a place in one of these
sections (which can always themselves be expanded or restructured to accommodate new material).

How-to guides
=============

As far as possible, each of these should be self-contained and describe an end-to-end workflow.
How-to guides should list pre-requisites - what the user needs to have done, and what the user
needs to know.

It's appropriate to give a little explanation in passing, but the emphasis should be on the
practical steps and what the user is doing. Any in-depth explanation should be reserved for the
reference documentation.

***************************************
Submitting a documentation pull request
***************************************

Our documentation is created with `Sphinx`_ and `restructuredText`_.

All documentation should be written in English (for now, anyway). Please don't feel that your
English isn't good enough; as long as it is understandable, we'll edit your text if that's required.

Feel free to submit work-in-progress pull requests, but mark them as such in the pull request title
if you do.

Documentation markup
====================

Sections
--------

We use Python documentation conventions for section marking:

* ``#`` with overline, for parts
* ``*`` with overline, for chapters
* ``=``, for sections
* ``-``, for subsections
* ``^``, for subsubsections
* ``"``, for paragraphs

Inline markup
-------------

* use double backticks - ````settings.py```` - for:
    * literals
    * filenames
    * names of fields and other items in the Admin interface:
* use emphasis - ``*Home*`` for:
    * the names of available options in the Admin
    * values in or of fields
* use strong emphasis - ``**Control Panel**`` for:
    * buttons that perform an action
    * the names of key Aldryn components when they are first used in a page or section

Internal links
--------------

Please use absolute link paths - `/packaging` - rather than relative paths - `packaging`. It makes
it much easier to update them with a search & replace when files are moved.
