The aim of the documents in this section is not to provide a comprehensive reference, but to take
you through the steps of some of the key processes you'll need to work through while using Aldryn.

For these operations you need to have some basic familiarity with the command-line on your system.

You also need to have a number of packages installed on your local computer. See :ref:`local_dev_install_configure` for more information.
