======================================
Aldryn's local development environment
======================================

If your code works with django CMS, you can expect it to work with Aldryn.

One of Aldryn's most important features is the way it allows you to deploy your own Django code
while providing you with a comfortable and familiar local environment for development.

Aldryn provides a fairly standard Django environment, which means that just about any Django code
can be deployed to Aldryn. It does however have some specific requirements. In order to be sure
that your code will run as expected on our cloud-based servers, the local environment it provides
replicates as far as possible the one your code will encounter when deployed.

.. ATTENTION::
   This documentation is currently in development. We'd be delighted to have :doc:`your feedback,
   or even better, your contributions </improving>`. This documentation is on `GitHub
   <https://github.com/aldryn/aldryn-docs>`_


Replicate your Aldryn site locally
==================================

You'll need the :ref:`Aldryn command-line client <aldryn_client>` installed, and a site - even the
most basic one will do - that's active on Aldryn.

The Aldryn client
-----------------

The client's available from PyPI::

    pip install aldryn-client

Replicate your Aldryn site locally
----------------------------------

Login to your Aldryn account::

    aldryn login

Now you need to replicate your Aldryn site in a local workspace::

    aldryn workspace create --sitename=<sitename> # substitute your actual site
    name

It'll take a few minutes to download and install all the dependencies. What you'll
see unfolding in your terminal is just what happens on the Aldryn server when you
create a new site.

Your Aldryn environment is in the ``<sitename>`` directory that has just been
created. Within it you'll find:

* ``.site`` - the Django project, complete with `manage.py`, settings, site static
  files and so on
* ``.virtualenv`` - the virtualenv for the Aldryn environment
* ``dev`` - a directory that Aldryn puts on the Python path for your convenience

Set up the local database
-------------------------

You'll need to get a local copy of your Aldryn database running.

Aldryn uses Postgres, so you will need a `PostgreSQL <http://www.postgresql.org>`_ server running
locally too.

In the Aldryn control panel, the *Manage this website* section offers options for
downloading and restoring databases:

#. create a new backup of your site
#. refresh the page
#. download the backup you have just created

The .tar file that has been downloaded. This contains the database, media files, and more.

#. unpack the .tar file that has been downloaded
#. using your local PostgreSQL database client, import the ``database.dump`` file
#. make sure that the new database's name and any permissions match those in the local site's ``settings.py``

Use local settings
------------------

You're going to need to adjust the settings for your local version of the project, so that it can
use your local database.

.. ATTENTION::
    Note that any changes you make locally to ``settings.py`` will not only not have any affect on
    Aldryn, the next time you synchronise your local project with the Aldryn version, those local
    changes will be lost. Try to avoid such changes altogether - mostly, they shouldn't be needed.

Rather than make changes to ``settings.py``, override the ``DATABASE_URL`` by setting an an
*environment variable*.

Create a file ``.env`` in the root of your site directory, containing::

    DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:@127.0.0.1:5432/<database_name>

Obviously, ``<database_name>`` needs to match the one you have created.

If you need to do anything more complex, you can use an environment variable to point to a local
`settings file <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/settings/#designating-the-settings>`_.

In your ``.env`` file::

    DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=local_settings

And in ``dev/local_settings.py`` import all the settings from the settings file from Aldryn, overriding
the ones you need to::

    from settings import *
    # override settings as required

For example to add a new application to ``INSTALLED_APPS`` (if the application has not already been
installed in the project on Aldryn)::

    INSTALLED_APPS += [
        'my_new_plugin',
        ]

Let's go
--------

You need to activate this new virtualenv, and fire up the Django runserver::

    source .virtualenv/bin/activate
    python .site/manage.py runserver

.. ATTENTION::
    Note that if you start the runserver, and try to visit a page on the site that
    requires database access *before* you have suplied database settings, the process
    won't exit when you quit the runserver. You'll need to find and kill the process
    manually before restarting it::

        ps aux | grep manage  # returns a list of matching processes
        kill <process_number>

You should see your site, or at least the "Your site is ready" message, and be
able to log into it.
