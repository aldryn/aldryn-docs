Create your site
#################

Login to the `Aldryn Control Panel <https://control.aldryn.com/control/>`_.

If you haven't already taken the **Aldryn tour**, do that now by selecting the
**Tour** button in the Control Panel.

Select **Add a new website**, and add a site - for now, choose to add one with
preinstalled theme and content, just to give you something to get started with.

Aldryn will take a few moments to duplicate the Django environment, including
django CMS and some :term:`Addons` as well as a populated database.

When that's ready, hit **Test it**. It'll take a few minutes to deploy.

This is the :term:`staging deployment <staging>` of your site.

In the **Dashboard** of the Control Panel, Aldryn should inform you that your site
is running smoothly.

When it has been deployed, login. Now you can explore the Aldryn **Standardsite**.
