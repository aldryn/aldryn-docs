`Aldryn`_ is an easy-to-use and developer-friendly content management platform.

Aldryn has been designed to meet the needs of:

* **web content creators**, who require an efficient and reliable way to produce content

* **agencies**, who work with multiple clients and content creators, and need to manage them all

* **web developers**, who implement designs and create applications, and need a low-friction
  workflow for their deployment

At the heart of Aldryn is `django CMS`_, a powerful and extensible open-source web content
management system, and a large - and growing - ecosystem of compatible applications.

The platform also provides:

* automated deployment
* hosting
* :doc:`shared team access </reference/workflows_for_agencies/index>`
* automated installation (including dependency management) and integration of
  third-party :term:`Addon` packages
* management via a web interface or desktop-based application


===============
Getting started
===============

New users should start with the :doc:`tutorial/index`. It's designed to give you the quickest
possible start with Aldryn, introducing you to key components and concepts of the system, so that
you feel comfortable and familiar with it and are ready to use it in earnest.

The tutorial takes you from first registration to publishing your site.
